| **1. Project Name**   |   |
| ***1.1 Full Name***     | OpenDocument Format (ODF) Advocacy  |
| ***1.2 Familiar Name*** | ODF-Advocacy |
|**2. Abstract**   | The objective of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) Advocacy Open Project at OASIS is to create awareness and educate the world about the benefits of using ODF. The group will develop advocacy materials for a sustained communication campaign about the importance of standard-based document interoperability versus proprietary formats.   |
|**3. Purpose and Scope**  | Educate users of personal productivity applications such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, presentation software, and the likes, about the advantages of adopting the international, ISO-published, ODF standard. Help users  migrate from pseudo-standard formats to ODF to ensure interoperability and save costs.<br/><br/>The following is an initial list of activities and materials which may be developed by the ODF Marketing Open Project:<br/><br/><ol><li>**Awareness**<ol><li>Dedicated Website</li><li>Social Media Campaign</li><li>Media Outreach Campaign</li><li>Conference Program - Plugfest</li></ol></li><li>**Education**<ol><li>What is a Document Standard?</li><li>Importance of Document Standards</li><li>Advantages of Document Standards</li><li>De Jure vs De Facto Standards</li></ol></li><li>**Marketing**<ol><li>Impact of Standards on Productivity</li><li>Economic Value of Interoperability</li><li>Competitive Advantages of ODF</li><li>Standards & Innovation</li></ol></li></ol> |
|**4. Business Benefits**   | Users of personal productivity software will benefit from the ODF awareness and education campaign, as they will learn about how true document interoperability can protect their data into the future and ensure freedom-of-choice in software.<br/><br/>Large organizations deploying personal productivity software will discover the huge savings made possible by ODF, with the associated advantage of increased security thanks to the reduced number of vulnerabilities affecting files based on standard file formats. (For a comparison, please search the NIST CVE database: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).|
|**5. Relationship to Other Projects**  |The ODF Advocacy Open Project can be related to other open source projects using ODF as their native file format such as Calligra, AbiWord and Gnumeric, or compatible with ODF such as Scribus.<br/>The ODF Advocacy Open Project can also be related to proprietary applications supporting ODF, provided they do not detract from the projectâ€™s original objective to promote the use of ODF.|
